I'm Isaac Z. Schlueter. I wrote npm and a pretty considerable
portion of other node related JavaScript that you might use.
I've been doing open source JavaScript for over two decades now.

For the last few years, I've been working my way through porting
all of my node packages to TypeScript and shipping them as hybrid
modules with support for both CommonJS and ES Modules.  You can
see links to their typedoc output on [my github.io
page](https://isaacs.github.io).
